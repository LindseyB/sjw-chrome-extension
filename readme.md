The SJW Extension
------------------

This will replace all instances of SJW with PB&J and if it's ever spelled out "Social Justice Warrior" it will replace the "warrior" with a random class.

**To Use**:

Right now this isn't an official extension so you'll need to open chrome extensions

1. Check 'Developer mode'

2. Click load unpacked extension and select the folder with the manifest file in it
